# Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and forecasts stock market trends using various time series analysis techniques. It explores historical patterns, identifies trends and seasonality, and makes short-term and long-term predictions for stock prices.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- **Time Series Models**: Facebook Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit (optional)
